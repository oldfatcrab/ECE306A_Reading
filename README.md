- Speech communication chain
    1. Think
    2. Semantics: pick out words to express the idea
    3. Symtax and Morphology: put these words together in a certain order following rules
    4. Phonology: figure out how to pronounce these words
    5. Articulatory phonetics: send those pronunciations to your vocal anatomy
    6. Speak: send the sounds throught the air
    7. Perceive: Listener hears the sounds.
    8. Decode: Listener interprets sounds as language
    9. Connect: Listener receives communicated idea

- **lexicon**: consists of the collection of all the words that you know
- **rules**: stored in the form of a **mental** grammar, a statement of some pattern that occurs in language.
    - **grammar**: set of all the elements and rules (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) that make up a language.

- Features of language:
    - **Mode of Communication**: means by which these messages are transmitted and received.
    - **Semanticity**: property requiring that all signals in a communication system have a meaning or a function.
    - **Pragmatic Function**: they must serve some useful purpose.
    - **Interchangeability**: ability of individuals to both transmit and receive messages.
    - **Cultural Transmission**: aspects that we can acquire only through communicative interaction with other users of the system.
    - **Arbitrariness**: generally recognized that the words of a language represent a connection between a group of sounds or signs.
        - Form + Meaning = Linguistic Sign
        - Arbitrariness in Language
        - Evidentce for Arbitrariness
        - Onomatopoeia
        - Sound Symbolism
        - Nonarbitrary Aspects of Language
    - **Discreteness**: property of language that allows us to combine together discrete units in order to create larger communicative units.
    - **Displacement**: ability of a language to communicate about things, actions, ideas and so on, that are not present in space or time while speakers are communicating.
    - **Productivity**: a language's capacity for novel messages to be build up out of discrete units.
